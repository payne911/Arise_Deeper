INCREMENTS:
    - FloodFiller inside the MapGenerator (spills Water on Floor Tiles randomly)
    - RayCasting algo inside the SightSystem
    - Interrupt MoveActions when a new Actor appears in sight


ADDITIONS:
    - Integrate Animations


REFACTORS:
    - Integrate AssetManager
    - Set up the TextureAtlas


UNCERTAINTIES:
    - Use a Pool for Actions (in TurnManager or ActionIssuer?)      to prevent using `new` all the time ???
    - "notify()" on GameObjects so that Actions can know if they should interrupt themselves (a state has changed)







==============IDEAS==============
