INCREMENTS:
    - FloodFiller inside the MapGenerator (spills Water on Floor Tiles randomly)
    - Interrupt MoveActions when a new Actor appears in sight
    - More level-generating algorithms


ADDITIONS:
    - Integrate Animations
    - Lerp for the MoveActions
    - Dynamic placement of objects in SecondaryLayer (including Enter/Exit doors)


REFACTORS:
    - Tileset should stop using the "TextureRegion.split()" and use ImageFactory instead


UNCERTAINTIES:
    - Use a Pool for Actions (in TurnManager or ActionIssuer?)      to prevent using `new` all the time ???
    - "notify()" on GameObjects so that Actions can know if they should interrupt themselves (a state has changed)
    - Builder pattern for the Settings in MainMenuScreen
    - Observer pattern for the animations's callback
    - Complete MVC by creating "Layer" classes for each map layer?







==============IDEAS==============
CLASSES:
    - Necro (restores health from consuming corpses, can create weak skeletons from corpses)
    - Fire elemental (can use Flame to restore energy)
    - Water elemental (can use Water Tiles to restore energy)
    - Rock elemental (can pick up the rocks on the ground Tiles)
